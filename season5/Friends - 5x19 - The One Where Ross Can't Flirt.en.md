Wow! You look nice.|What's the occasion?
Monica and I are celebrating|our 10-month anniversary.
Got reservations at Jean-George.
How'd you get in?
Made a few calls,|pulled some strings...
...and they'll seat us if we both|have chicken and don't get dessert.
- Hi, Chandler.|- Hey, Caitlin.
Somebody got a haircut.
I hate it. I look like|an eight-year-old boy.
If that was true, gym class|would've been more interesting.
- It's $27 even.|- Okay. Here you go.
Where's the chicken?
It's in the back.|The duck pissed him off.
He said that eggs came first.
- Thanks. I'll see you later.|- Bye.
What the hell was that?
- What?|- The flirting.
Aren't you supposed to be going out|with, let's see, my sister?
I wasn't flirting.
It was totally flirting!|"Somebody got a haircut..."
First of all, the impression?|Uncanny.
Second, that wasn't flirting.|That was just casual conversation.
Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting?|I'll show you.
I'm good.
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt
I am so proud of Joey.
- He's gonna be on "Law and Order"!|- I know.
Don't you think it should|be called "Order and Law"?
No, because they arrest the guy|and then try him.
Don't get me started on that.
- I was not flirting.|- And on your anniversary. For shame!
What's going on?
He was hitting on|the hot delivery girl.
I was not. And oh, God!
You were. If anyone|should be hitting on her...
...it's the guy who's single...
...the guy who can do|something about it.
Sounds like someone wants to be|Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Is that what this is about?|You like Caitlin?
Ross, we broke up two years ago.|You've been married since then.
I think it's okay|that we see other people.
I was watching her|at the pizza place.
And she was just so sexy and funny|and has the cutest little...
We don't need her measurements.
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.
She's pretty and you love her,|but is she stupid?
She forgot my vegetarian.
This is perfect. She'll have|to come back here with your pizza.
And when she does,|I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.
I am so glad you don't eat meat.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Hey, everybody, look who's here!|You remember my grandmother.
- Big night!|- Yeah, it's so cool.
Joey on "Law and Order".|You must be proud.
She doesn't understand|a word of English.
I thought you were|Joey's other grandmother.
I've done it again.
Nonnie's my biggest fan.
She's the only one in the family|who's always believed in me.
"Sï¿½." Big star.
My big fat Joey star.
Yeah, I weighed, like,|27 pounds when I was born.
- Happy anniversary!|- Happy anniversary, 10 months.
In the shower I was thinking|about our first night in London.
Joey's grandmother's right there.
- The one who speaks English?|- The one who doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me.
- I'll get ready.|- Wear those earrings I got you.
That's a great idea. I was saving|them for something special.
- You've got to go home.|- But I like it here.
Get the earrings you borrowed.|He wants me to wear them.
I think they're in my purse.|Go get dressed and I'll look for them.
I need those earrings you borrowed.
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Pheebs, you speak Italian?
I guess so.
- Here you go.|- Thanks. Where's the other one?
Oh, what, you want both of them?
Rachel Karen Greene,|where's the other one?
Look, just don't freak out,|but I kind of lost it.
I know it's in the apartment,|but I definitely lost it.
What'll I tell Monica?|She wants to wear them tonight.
- Tell her to wear her own earrings.|- These are her earrings.
You lent me her earrings?|I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
- Why not?|- Because I lose her stuff!
You see that blind guy?|I'm gonna bash his head in later.
My big scene's coming up.|The big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up",|would she know the difference?
What are you doing?
Oh, I just can't watch.|It's too scary.
It's a diaper commercial.
Yeah, well, you know me.|Babies, responsibilities...
- Pizza delivery.|- I'll get it! I will get that!
One vegetarian pizza.|It's 12.50.
By the way, if it makes|you feel any better...
...I happen to like|eight-year-old boys.
What?
Your hair.|Before. Your hair.
You said you thought your hair|looked like an eight-year-old boy's...
...and I'm just saying I like it.
The hair.
Thanks.
You understand, I don't actually|like eight-year-old boys.
All I'm looking for is the money.
Here you go.|Stop bringing us pizzas, you.
I'm gonna try.
You're welcome.
You couldn't let me have her,|could you?
This is a girl I really like,|and you had to swoop in there!
What?
Chandler was flirting|with the hot delivery girl.
Thank you for that.
I was not flirting.
It's okay. I don't care.|That's fine.
Really?
It's no big deal.|I do it all the time.
You flirt with guys all the time?
It doesn't mean anything. Just like|it doesn't mean anything with you.
There's a difference.|You're a lot hotter.
True story.
This actually bothers you?
Yes, and I think|it'd bother a lot of people.
When you and Ross dated...
...did it bother you|when he flirted with other women?
No, it bothered me when|he slept with other women.
And thank you for that.
I never had to worry.
He was never good|at the flirting thing.
What are you talking about?|It worked with you.
No, you're right.
We met, you flirted and then bam!|Nine years later, you had me.
All right.
You know what I'll do?|I'll order another pizza.
And when Caitlin gets here...
...I will show you how well I flirt.
I will get her phone number.
And not the one on the menu.
- I found it.|- Thank God! Where was it?
On your dresser.
Okay, that is the one we already have.
Here's my big scene.|My big scene's here.
{y:i}- Wanna bet nobody heard anything?|{y:i}- No bet.
{y:i}Anybody home?
- Oh, my God.|- What?
Everybody keep smiling. It'll kill|my grandmother if she finds out.
What is it?
They cut me out of the show.
What?
- Are you sure?|- Maybe your scene's coming up.
Not likely. Because you see|that body bag right there?
I'm in it.
This is terrible.|What'll you do?
I don't know. This little|old lady lives for my career.
When they dumped me off|"Days of Our Lives", she almost died.
That's not good.
You're not smiling. Not that face!|Everybody smile!
Just tell her what happened.|It's not your fault.
If we keep talking this way,|won't we freak her out soon?
Soon. I'm gonna be on soon.
There I am!
Sam Waterston!
No, no. That's me.|That's me!
No. Sam Waterston.
{y:i}Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.
She doesn't know "hello",|but she knows "Capricorn One".
I need those earrings.|We're leaving when the show's over.
But I already gave them back to you.
No, you didn't.
I already didn't gave them back to you.|That's what I said.
Where's that other earring?
It's not here, Pheebs.|It's not here.
I went to Chandler's last night.
Make sure you check|Chandler's jewelry box.
Chandler has a jewelry box?
We have 10 minutes. Do you|want me to get into that now?
Hey, Pheebs.
How's that...
...vegetarian pizza|working out for you?
You and those vegetables|have a real...
...thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird?
Do you like it?
No. That'd be,|"Why are you being cute?"
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.
I did not get that.
So, Monica, do you like|"Law and Order"?
Yeah, it's good.
I found out all this stuff about you.|You like "Law and Order"...
...and you've flirted with every guy|in the tri-state area.
Okay, let me get this straight.
It's okay for you to flirt,|but not for me?
I'm glad we cleared that up.
I'm sorry, but some things are|different for men and women.
Teach me about men and women.
I've already taught you|so much already, but whatever.
When you flirt with a guy,|you think, "No big deal."
But he thinks, "Finally!|Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
- No way!|- It's true.
- Well, that's pathetic.|- Again, true.
- This goes for all guys?|- All guys that are awake.
We go to sleep.
All guys from the other end of the|world wake up and act the same way.
It's another commercial|and I still haven't told her.
Joey, this is the last commercial.
- You got 10 minutes left.|- I know!
What am I gonna do?
You will not run out|and leave her here.
Yeah, all right.
Joey's gonna be right back.|Right back?
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.
So, you're old and small.
Did you find it?
The earring, no.|But I found my sunglasses.
I've been looking for these|since last summer.
Those are mine.|You borrowed them from me.
Okay. Calm down.|Here they are.
- What do we do?|- I don't know. I don't know!
We'll just have|to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.
I could tell her it was all my fault.
Oh, that'd be great.
Mon, could I talk to you?
Yeah. What is it?
I lost one of your earrings.
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.
All right, what can you do?|If you lost it, you lost it.
I'll replace it. I promise.|I feel so terrible.
That's fine.|You didn't do it on purpose.
Look at you. Come here.
- You feel better?|- Yeah. You're the best.
Okay, wait a minute.
I can't do this.
Listen, honey,|it's not Phoebe's fault.
She lent me the earrings.
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.|I feel terrible too.
That is exactly why|I do not lend you stuff!
First, my jewelry.|If it's not that, it's my sweater.
And if it's not that,|it's my sunglasses.
Your sunglasses?
Oh, right.
- Pizza.|- Mine, mine, mine!
Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves|for some class-A flirting.
Okay, hold on.
If you really like this girl, I don't|think flirting is the right way...
You'll see.
What's her name?
Caitlin!
We can't keep eating like this.
It's $12.50.
Do you make the pizzas in one|of those wood-burning ovens?
No, actually, I think they're gas.
Gas?
Intense.
If this is how all the Gellers flirt,|we don't have a problem.
You know that smell gas has?
They put that in.
What?
The gas is odorless.
But they add the smell|so you know when there's a leak.
Well, okay.
A lot of other gas smells.
Oh, the humanity!
Methane smells...
You know what?|Actually, I really should go.
- But I haven't paid you yet.|- That's okay.
You guys have ordered so many|that this one's on me.
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
In nine years, she and I|will be right there!
I'm gonna clear out|some of these boxes.
What else do they add smell to?
Caitlin! Caitlin!
Hi, I'm Rachel.
The people with all the pizza.
Was there a problem?
No, they're fine. Great pizza.
But, actually, my friend Ross|gets nervous when he's flirting.
Oh, my God!
That was flirting?
I know, I know.
I'm telling you,|once you get past that part...
...where it feels|like you wanna die...
...he's a really good person.
The guy with the gas?
I'm telling you, he's really|sweet and really funny...
...and he's just got a good heart.
- Besides, I think he really likes you.|- Really?
Well, we have seven people|and 10 pizzas. What do you think?
I thought Joey was there.
Hey, Ross?
I just ran into Caitlin|in the hallway.
You must be getting better at|this flirting stuff than I thought.
What?
I don't get it, but she wanted me|to give you her number.
And she just gave you this?
Rach, thanks. But I don't need|you doing me any favors.
I didn't.|She thought you were cute.
Well, that I can believe.
Hey, is the show still on?
Almost over, man.
Hey, Nonnie.
Is that the Pope?
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am!|This is my big scene.
{y:i}All right, back off!
{y:i}I got a gun!
{y:i}I'm not afraid to use it.
That's right, Nonnie.
You couldn't have at least|changed your shirt?
{y:i}Now, I want a suitcase|{y:i}filled with $100,000...
{y:i}Filled with $100,000|{y:i}in small bills.
{y:i}And if I don't get...|{y:i}Shoo!
{y:i}And if I don't get it...
{y:i}... I'll shoot this duck!
Oh, no!
{y:i}I'm coming out!
And she's supposed to buy this?
{y:i}Ground control to Major Tom
{y:i}Commencing countdown
{y:i}Engines...
{y:i}... on
That's scenes from next week's show.|Next week.
I am definitely gonna watch that.
Do these look the same?
Definitely.
Not as each other.
Then, no.
- Hey, you ready?|- Yeah.
You look amazing.|I'm the luckiest man in the world.
You're about to get|a little luckier.
- Let me see the earrings.|- Right, the earrings.
They look great.
Does your boyfriend have|the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does|have great taste.
Thanks for picking out the earrings.
