{y:i}Any entertainment there?
All right. Here we go!|1999, the year of Joey.
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?
We wanted to kiss at midnight,|but nobody else will so...
All right, I'll take care of it.
Thirty-three... thirty-two...|thirty-one...
Who are you kissing at midnight?|Rachel or Phoebe?
You can't kiss your sister.
- Who will kiss my sister?|- Chandler.
Oh, man! Really?
Would you rather|have me or him kiss her?
That's a good point.
Since I have that whole history|with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Pheebs! Listen.|Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.
So obvious.|Why doesn't he just ask?
I'm going to kiss you at midnight.
You can't kiss Ross.|You got the history.
So?
- Would you prefer me or Chandler?|- Good point.
Three... two... one!
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.|- You too.
Happy New Year, Joey.
So, that do anything for you?
The One with|All the Resolutions
You know what?
I'm going to go out on a limb|and say, "No divorces in '99"!
But your divorce isn't final yet.
Just the one divorce in '99!
I'm going to be happy this year.|I'm going to make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room?
Every day, I am going to do one thing|I have never done before.
That is my New Year's resolution.
That's a good one!
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Now you only have to find|a planeload of people...
...whose resolution is|to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution should be|not to make fun of your friends.
Especially the ones who might|fly you to Europe for free.
She has a better chance|of flying up your nose...
...than you do of|not making fun of us.
I'll bet $50 you can't go the year|without making fun of us.
Better yet, a week.
I'll take that bet, my friend.
Paying me the $50 can be...
...the "new thing you do" that day.
And it starts right now!
My New Year's resolution is|to learn how to play guitar.
Really? How come?
You know those special skills|I have listed on my r�sum�?
I would love it|if one of those was true.
Want me to teach you?|I'm great.
Really?|Who have you taught?
I taught me and I loved me.
That'd be great!|Yeah, thanks, Pheebs.
Look. Blaire forgot her glasses.
She'll need these to keep an eye|on that boyfriend.
Who, from what I hear,|needs to keep his stapler...
...in his desk drawer,|if you know what I mean!
Maybe your resolution|should be to gossip less.
What? I don't gossip.
Maybe sometimes I find out things.
Or I hear something|and I pass that information on.
You know, kind of|like a public service.
It doesn't mean I'm a gossip.|Is Ted Koppel a gossip?
If Ted Koppel talked about his|coworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.
They were like this!
I'll see you tomorrow.
I just asked that girl out.
Nice!
Is that part of|your "new thing" for today?
Yes, it is. See?
"Elizabeth...
...Hornswoggle?"
That's right.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
You okay, Chandler?
Something funny about that name?
No, I just think|I've heard it somewhere before.
Oh, really? Where?
Somewhere funny I'll bet.
Guess what?
I have a date|with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh, this must be killing you!
All right, see you later.
All right, Pheebs,|I am ready for my first lesson.
No, you don't touch the guitar.
First you learn here, then here.
Lesson One: Chords.
Now, I don't know|the actual names of the chords.
But I made up names for the way|my hand looks while I'm doing them.
So then, this is "Bear Claw".
"Turkey Leg"...
...and "Old Lady".
What an interesting approach|to guitar instruction!
You know, some might find it amusing.|I myself find it regular.
Hey, everybody!
Rachel was so good today.|She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't.|Even when I found out...
Let's say I found out|something about someone...
...and let's just say...
...she's going to keep it.
Check this out.
You nailed the Old Lady!
I thought I was getting better,|so I stopped by this guitar store...
Did you touch|any of the guitars there?
Did you?
No.
Give me your hands.
Strings.
Pick.
Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Then don't touch one!
- Hi, Ben.|- Auntie Monica!
Ross is wearing leather pants!
Does nobody else see|Ross is wearing leather pants?
Someone comment on the pants!
- I think they're very nice.|- I really like them a lot.
Not what I had in mind.
People like Ross don't wear|these types of pants.
You see, they're very tight.
Maybe there's something in that area?
I think they look really good.
Where'd you get them?
I needed a "new thing" for today.
There's this leather store|that always smells so good.
And I thought to myself, "Wow!|I've never owned...
...a really good-smelling|pair of pants before."
Oh, come on!
What do you think?
You look like a freak.
Awful!
What are you doing?
- It's my New Year's resolution.|- To blind my child?
To take pictures of us together.
It's the best resolution.|Everyone can enjoy them.
Everyone will enjoy my music as well.
{y:i}My God, these pants!|{y:i}I'm burning up.
{y:i}Oh God! She wants to snuggle now?|{y:i}Is she trying to kill me?
{y:i}It's like a volcano in here!
Are you hot?
It must just be me then.
That was just the pants|and the couch.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
- Go ahead.|- Thanks.
My favorite part's coming up!
Oh, my God!
"Tiger."
"Dragon."
"Iceberg!"
Joseph, did you even study|at all last night?
Yes, I did!
Then do Iceberg.
G-sharp.
G-sharp?
Have you been studying|the real names of the chords?
Have you?
Oh, my God!
What? I didn't touch a guitar!
But you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning it.|I'm saying it's stupid!
What?
Thank you.
You know, none of my other student...
...thought I was stupid.
Your other student was you!
Well, maybe you just need|to try a little harder!
Maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Here! Andy Cooper.|He teaches guitar.
There's a picture of him with a kid.
And the kid's got a guitar!
Fine!
You learn from|your "qualified instructor".
But don't come crying|when everyone is sick...
...of hearing you play|"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"!
Oh, fine. Take his side!
{y:i}I can't wait to be with you.
{y:i}I'll sneak over as soon as I can.
{y:i}I'll tell Rachel|{y:i}I'll be doing laundry.
{y:i}Laundry.|{y:i}Is that my new nickname?
{y:i}You know what your nickname is,|{y:i}Mr. Big...
Joey, it's Ross.|I need some help.
Chandler's not here.
You can help me.
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.
Nice!
No, I got really hot in my pants|so I took them off.
But they must have shrunk|from the sweat.
Or my legs expanded from the heat.
I can't get them back on, Joey.|I can't!
That is quite a situation.
Do you see any powder?
Powder! Yeah, I have powder.
{y:i}Good, good.
Sprinkle some on.|It'll absorb moisture.
Then you can get your pants on.
Yeah, hold on.
They're not coming on, man.
You see any...|Oh, Vaseline?
I see lotion. I have lotion.|Will that work?
Sure, throw some of that on there.
{y:i}Hold on.
Ross, you okay?
They're still not coming on, man.
And the lotion and the powder|have made a paste.
Really?
What color is it?
What difference does that make?
If the paste matches the pants,|you can make paste pants...
...and she won't know!
Do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I...
Rachel's here, so good luck.|Let me know how it goes.
Joey, I have such a problem.
Your timing couldn't be better.
I'm putting out fires|all over the place.
I have got to tell you something.
What is it?
It's so huge! But promise me|you cannot tell anyone.
No, no, no!|I don't want to know.
You do want to know.|This is unbelievable!
I'm tired of being the guy|who knows all the secrets...
...and can't tell anyone.
You know secrets?
You're not supposed to gossip!
I can't keep this in.|So I pick up the phone...
I'm not listening to you!
You've been in there for a long time.
I'm starting to get|kind of freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out.
Hey, can you turn the lights off?
Let's just leave the lights on.
Oh, my God!
I had a problem.
I can't talk to you. I don't have|a fancy ad in the yellow pages.
I want to apologize for saying|your method was stupid.
And maybe, ask you|to be my teacher again?
I promise, I won't touch a guitar|until you say I'm ready.
You really think I'm ready?
Wow, cool!
Was the chord at least right...
Oh, my God!
We heard about your pants.|I'm so sorry.
This year was supposed to be great.
It's only the second day,|and I'm a loser...
...with stupid leather pants|that don't even fit!
You're not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, look!
Ben drew a picture of you.
You're a cowboy!
Because of the leather pants?
He thinks you're a cowboy,|not a loser. That's something!
- It really is something.|- Howdy, partner!
Maybe I should get another pair.
You know, they had some...
...with fringe all down the sides.
I'm going to go kiss Ben good night.
I can't believe he thinks|I'm a cowboy!
I would make a good cowboy.
Now that everything's wrapped up,|I'll do my laundry.
Yeah, me too.|If this shirt is dirty.
I'm going to the airport.
If I hang around there|long enough...
...someone's bound to leave|a plane unattended.
- Good luck, honey.|- Bye.
Remember that thing|I was going to tell you about?
I won't tell you.|But if you found out on your own...
That would be okay,|and we could talk about it.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.|So that would be okay.
Would you mind going|into Chandler's bedroom...
...and getting that book|he borrowed from me?
Now? You want me|to go over there now?
- Do you know something?|- Do you?
- I might know something.|- I might too.
- What do you know?|- You tell me first.
- I can't.|- Then I can't.
Okay, fine.
You don't know.
I'll walk into his bedroom|and see the thing...
...I think I know is actually|the thing I think I know!
- You know!|- And you know!
Yeah, I know!
Chandler and Monica?|Oh, this is unbelievable!
- How long have you known?|- Too long!
I've been dying to talk|to someone about this!
You can't say anything to anybody.|They're so weird about that.
It's raining.
I don't like to fly in the rain.
I am going to go for a walk|in the rain.
Me too.
That's weird.
I bet they're doing it.
Okay, look.|I can't take it anymore.
So you win. Okay?|Here.
Fly a jet?|Make it a spaceship...
...so you can get back|to your home planet!
Phone call for you. Tom Jones.|He wants his pants back!
And Hornswoggle? Are you dating|a character from "Fraggle Rock"?
