Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?
No, look.
That's a pig.
I know.|But look at the knobs on it!
Emily's cousin kicked me out.
- What?|- Why?
When you sublet|from your wife's cousin...
...then you divorce, sometimes|the cousin wants his apartment back.
Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
You can stay with us.
Anything you need.
But you have to let us know|when you feel better...
...so we can make fun of your hair.
You got it.
Thanks, I really appreciate this.|I'm going to get packing again.
I've been moving around so much|that I feel like a nomad.
He thought you said gonad.
The One Where Ross Moves In
If every place were this clean,|it'd be tough making a living.
Oh, Larry!
Do health inspectors|work on commission?
No, bribes.
- It's okay to laugh?|- I was just kidding.
- I'll check the kitchen floor.|- Knock yourself out.
Yummy!
Yeah, I'd let him check out|my kitchen floor.
A ninety-eight.
I deducted two points|for not wearing your hat.
That is a Section 5 violation.
Now look, Larry, honey.
I wrote the book on Section 5.
You only need to wear it|in the kitchen.
Where's your hat?
In the kitchen. I'll get it.
There's the two points!
You should really read|that book you wrote.
You saw the hat in the kitchen and|knew she'd go in hatless to get it.
You could have your own|health inspector detective show.
I don't know about that.
But then I could be|your sidekick, Voonda.
Maybe I could ask Voonda|to dinner sometime?
She would love that...
...since you know|all the clean places to eat.
I'll call you.
He's so funny!
Thank you.
How's Ross doing|since all the Emily stuff?
He's not great.
But he's dealing with it.|Wait, you're not...
I can't get started|with all that Ross stuff again.
He'll be screwed up for a long time.
Besides, I don't go for guys|right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them|five minutes before they get married.
- Two pounds of mocha java.|- It's Danny.
Are you going to go out again?
I don't know.|He hasn't called since we went out.
I see him in the hallway.|We flirt. I'm all...
...and then nothing.
Wow, thirsty.
I'm having a party on Saturday.|Sort of a housewarming thing.
- Fun.|- Great!
I'm looking forward to it.
See you!
So I guess we won't|be warming his house.
All right, I see what he's doing.
He's not asking me out|because he wants me to ask him out.
And you won't do that.
That's right!
Because that would give him|the control.
So now he comes up with this|"I've got a party" thing...
...to get me to hint|for an invitation.
Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So there is no party?
No, there's a party.|There's a party.
But the power?
That is still up for grabs.
You follow me?
I think so.
So he won't invite you to his party|because he likes you?
Exactly!
Hey, roomies!
I love what you've done|with the place.
I know it's a lot of boxes.
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.|- Not a problem.
Since you'll be here a while...
...we could put your name|on the answering machine.
I hope you don't mind...
...but I kind of already|jazzed it up a little.
Check it out.
{y:i}We will
{y:i}We will call you back
Pretty cool.
- You're fake laughing too, right?|- The tears are real.
You look beautiful this evening.
Show me the badge again.
Shiny.
You mind if I wash up?|Who knows where these have been?
You are just nonstop!
- We're out of here.|- Why?
I saw ten violations.|I'm shutting this place down!
- You have the power to do that?|- This does.
Shut it down.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You built a fort, didn't you?
Kind of.
Oh, my God! The air purifier.|Ross' air purifier.
All I heard for four years|through college was...
You should have gone out|once in a while.
- I hate this thing!|- Come on, Chandler.
Ross is our friend.|He needs us right now.
So why don't you be a grownup|and come watch TV in the fort?
I wanted to invite you to the party.
Thanks, I'll try to stop by.
Actually, I think|I'm going to be busy.
You are?
Remember, I've got that gala?
What's the gala for?
It's a regatta gala.
Do you sail?
No, but I support it.
I hope I see you tomorrow night.|Take care.
Walked right into that one,|didn't he?
What one?
You wanted him to invite you|and he did.
He waited until the last minute.|So if I said yes...
...he'd know I had nothing better|to do than wait for his invitation.
But I said no...
...which puts me back|in the driver's seat.
So the ball is in his court?
Ball?
No, there's no ball.
Joey, please.
Sorry.
Hello, children.
You want to play some foosball?|Please?
We moved the table into my room|because of all the boxes.
Come on!
I have one question.
What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing.
You mean this.
I don't know how much more|I can take.
Did you know he taped over my "Baywatch"|tape with a show about bugs?
My God!
What if that had been porn?
All right, this may be tough...
...but it's Ross.|I survived college with him.
I guess I can hold out|a little longer.
Let's have a game.
Fellas?
So he's out of here.
Got anything to eat?|I went to Jono's and it was closed.
I took Larry there, but it was all|violated, so we shut it down.
If this guy keeps closing our|favorite places, where will we eat?
I don't know. Clean places?
Yum!
It's Danny.
Don't let him in!|I'm supposed to be at a gala.
We'll be right there.|Can't you say it's later?
What kind of a regatta gala|starts at night?
The fake kind.
- I need a ladle. You got a ladle?|- We have a ladle.
See you at the party.
You know what Larry would say?|He'd say, "See you ladle."
I'm done. You want anything?|Sports? International?
Apartment listings?
I'll take sports.
Mine!
All right, international.
That's mine too.
I'm Italian.
I could check apartment listings,|though there's never anything here.
Not even on page seven?
You're right.|Here's an affordable place.
Two bedroom, close to work.|It's available in five weeks.
What about that circled one?
It's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Let's go look at it!
There we go!
Guys, would you chip in for some|new air filters for the purifier?
I mean, after all,|we are all using it.
Let's go quicker!
Oh, my God!
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.
That's great!|So you can cook while in the tub.
Somebody was using his head.
Let's check out|the rest of the place.
I think this is it.
I don't know.|Maybe we should keep looking.
But this place is available now.
You don't want to be stuck|with us for five weeks.
So you think I should|take this place?
It's perfect!
How about you?
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.
I see what you guys are saying.
I'll go downstairs|and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying|to get rid of him.
Could we get a bathtub|in our kitchen?
Ready for dinner?
- Absolutely.|- Great.
You wanted to go to|the Italian place on Bleecker St.?
I love that place!
So, no.
How about Mama Lozetti's?
Sure.
How long has that milk|been sitting out?
No, this place is totally healthy.
This milk is mine.|I bought this today...
...because I was thirsty for milk,|you know?
Okay, let's go.
Hey, buddy.
Health Code 11 B requires that refuse|be taken out the back exit.
But then I have to go|all the way around.
So you choose convenience|over health?
Stop, Larry.
Can't you just be Larry and not|Larry the health inspector guy?
It was exciting at first.
But now, it's like, so where|are we going to eat ever?
I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Go, go!
If, after dinner,|you still need to bust someone...
...I know a hot dog vendor|who picks his nose.
Maybe we did good,|helping Ross get back on his feet.
That was a nice place.
No closet space, but he could hang|his stuff out the window in a bag.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
It's the apartment manager.|Ross put us as references.
Ross is the greatest guy.|He's very reliable...
Of course, he has a big, huge dog|that barks into the night.
Well, who doesn't love dogs?
He's a tap dancer.
Yes, some would say|that is a lost art.
He's a pimp!
There you go. He's a pimp.
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!
This is never going to work.|He's right there.
Just go say hi.
I have to go downstairs and back up,|as if I'm coming home from the gala.
So just go distract him.|But don't be sexy.
What's going on?
This is a great party.|Great food.
You know, most parties, it's all|chips and salsa, chips and salsa.
So...
What's this?
Salad.
And what's this?
Bread.
Aren't you a chef?
Right, tonight was your party.
You look great!|I'm glad you made it.
Well, you know,|the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere.|I'll be right back.
Whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball.
Come on. He's glad I came.|He doesn't want me to go anywhere.
Ball's flying all over the place.
This is my friend, Tom.
This is the girl I told you about.
Come on!|You telling people about me?
I think you two|could really hit it off.
I'm gonna to go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's?|My mom calls it "Bloomies".
At ease, soldier!
I'm sorry?
You can just drop the act.|I know what's going on.
You're Danny's wingman, right?
You guys are best buds, frat bros.
I'm going to go talk to a friend.
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.
Go tell him, "Nice try."
He just keeps lobbing them up...
...and I keep knocking them|right out of the park.
I think I need a drink.
Ninety-eight...
...ninety-nine...
...one hundred!
Okay. Go.
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Here we go, here we go.
So I didn't get that apartment.|Some problem with my application.
You're kidding?
But Phoebe said I could stay|at her place for a while, so...
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.|We're roomies.
You don't need me|taking up all your space.
We got plenty of space.|There's still some by that speaker.
Please, just stay.
Are you sure?
- Definitely.|- You have to stay.
So I'm a pimp, huh?
It's okay.
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.
But just talk to me.|Tell me if something bothers you.
And I'll do everything I can|to keep my annoying habits just...
Well, I see you've had|a very productive day.
The cowboy hat's a little much.
Come on, it's fun!
All right.
Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy,|and make us some tea!
