- Good! You guys are all here.|- What's up?
I have a job interview|at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.
Congratulations!
Oh, boy.|That guy's underwear sucks!
What?
Well, I got this pair marked "XS".
Let me tell you, there was no room|for excess anything in there.
I'll be the coordinator|of the women's collection.
I'll work right under the director.|It's the perfect job for me!
If you nail the interview,|you'll get it.
You want to work|on your interview skills?
Let's start with the handshake.
Very good handshake.|Good wrist action.
Let me try.
Oh, my God!|What did I ever do to you?
Did I squeeze too hard?
Let's just say|I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss
That's right, Ross.|I can see you in your new apartment.
Same as yesterday,|same as the day before.
Is he doing|his "shark attack" bit?
No. Oh, wait!|There he goes.
Very funny, Ross.
Very lifelike and funny.
No, no.|I wasn't waving at you, lady.
Whoa, maybe I was.
This hot girl in Ross' building|is flirting with me.
Get in there, man.|Flirt back. Mix it up!
Yeah, I'm down with that.
Okay, here goes.
How...
...you...
...doing?
It worked! She's waving me over.|I'll be right over.
Let's see,|she's on the third floor...
- She is pretty, huh?|- Tell me about it.
No, no! I'm not with her.
That's just Monica.
Hey, Joey!
Great stuff, huh?
This your place?
Yeah, of course it is.|Come on in.
Go by the window.|You can pretend to be surfing.
I counted.|You're not supposed to live here!
Oh, man!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross' place.|I must have miscounted or something.
Damn! She's not there anymore.
Look, Ross is doing|his "watching TV" bit.
No, Joe, I think|he's just watching TV.
{y:i}We've lost visual contact|{y:i}with the suspect.
Okay, now I really have to go.
It's so unfair that|our date has to get cut short...
...just because some guy|shot at a store clerk.
- I know, but it's my job.|- Then maybe I could come too?
{y:i}Suspect has just emerged|{y:i}naked from the sewer.
All right, you go.
Oh, God!
Oh, I just miss him so much!
For just a week,|you guys are close.
Yeah, it's weird.|I can't help it. He's so sweet.
He's like this little|puppy dog, you know?
But like a really tough one|who shoots bad guys.
I love the beginning parts|of relationships.
You can't keep your hands|off each other.
I know. It is the best.
How long did that last|for you and Chandler?
What? It's still going on.
Come on, seriously.|When did it end?
I am serious. We're all over|each other all the time.
Okay, you know where you are|better than I do.
Why don't you just calm down?
Get all your facts before you tell|everybody you're the only hot couple.
God, I woke the beast.
I was wrong obviously.|I just misspoke. It's okay.
It is okay.
As long as you know Chandler and I|are also hot and fiery.
Just as hot as you.
I mean, our flame...
It is on fire!
Here's your broom back.
You are so cute!
How'd the interview go?
Horrible! I did the stupidest,|most embarrassing thing.
Did you say you wanted to have sex|with his wife then fall off your chair?
So what happened?
It was horrible!|And the interview part went so well.
I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat...
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,|if you've got enough life jackets."
Trust me.|It was actually very funny.
Anyway, we were|saying goodbye and...
What happened?
We were shaking hands...
{y:i}... and he leaned in toward me.
{y:i}Maybe he was opening the door...
{y:i}... but I totally|{y:i}misread him and I...
You kissed him?
I didn't know what else to do!
You could have tried...
...not kissing him.
Thanks, Chandler.
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.|You got a second interview.
I can't believe it!|I got a second interview.
That kiss isn't looking like|such a mistake now, is it?
You don't think that's|why he wants me back?
Yeah!
No?
What are you talking about?
I accidentally kissed him|in the interview...
...and now he wants me back...
...because, "Let's bring back|the girl who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.
What if he thinks|I'll just sleep with him?
He wants you back because|you're right for the job.
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!|How could I be so stupid?
Rachel, don't say that. I think|you just need a hug from Joey.
Come on. Come on.
She's back! Hot girl's back!
Well, I'm not totally back yet.|But I appreciate it.
No. In Ross' building.|She's back!
Wait there.|I'll be over in a second.
One, two, three...|Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl.
There she is!
Damn it! Did you move?
Yes.
I lived with you for a while.|Then I found this place.
I'm Ross.
Do you happen to have|a hot girl in there?
No, I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that.
Hey, little girl.
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter|by any chance, a hot girl?
Daddy!
Later, girl!
Oh, man!
Hot girl?
Hot girl!
Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
- It's nice to see you again.|- Thank you.
What?
Excuse me?
Yeah, let me...
Okay, I see what's going on here.|Now, look...
...I'm sorry if I gave you|the wrong impression.
But I am not some hussy who will|just sleep around to get ahead.
Even though I kissed you,|that does not give you...
...the right to demand sex from me!|I do not want this job that bad.
Good day, sir.
You are not gonna believe...
...what that sleazeball|from Ralph Lauren did to me!
Okay, that's amazing!|How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
What do you say, maybe,|sometime I hold your gun?
We're not supposed to do that.
What could happen? I mean...
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
- Do you want to see a movie tonight?|- We can't. We already have plans.
What are you doing?
Well, same thing we did all day.|Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
He is so amazing.|We never left the bedroom.
But have fun at the movie.
Well, we're not seeing a movie.
Then why did you ask us|if we wanted to go?
Because I just wanted|to know what you were doing...
...so you wouldn't walk in|on me and Chandler...
...while we were doing it all night.
Will you excuse me?
Chandler?|Can I see you for a second?
- We have got to beat them!|- Why?
Because Gary and Phoebe think|they're a hotter couple than us.
So?
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex|and prove them wrong!
You've got to stop this|competitive thing. It's crazy.
Just to impress them, you want us|to have sex over and over...
...and I'm saying no to this, why?|Get your coat!
Excuse me.
You should check this out.|Tell the other tenants.
Apparently, he's looking|for some kind of hot girl.
Who isn't?
I don't think we've met.|I'm Ross.
I know. You're the guy who|wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Never mind.
I actually thought it was unfair|the way everyone reacted.
I mean, you had just moved in.
I had just moved in!
Thank you!
Listen...
Jen.
I know this may sound a little...
But would you want to grab|a cup of coffee sometime?
Sure, that would be nice.
My number's on there.|Give me a call.
I will give you a call.
- I'll see you later.|- Okay.
I forgot my paper.
That was amazing.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna|hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
We are the hottest, huh?
No one is hotter than we are.
- We're the best.|- No, you're the best.
- No, you're the best.|- No, you're the best.
I am the best.
Hey, guys.
What you been doing?
Isn't that the girl who waved at you?
I don't know, but I can|see through your sheet.
Yeah, that's her.
You know, it doesn't matter.|I'll never meet her.
It's impossible to find her apartment!
She lives in some hot-girl|parallel universe or something.
What are you talking about?
She lives on the 2nd floor,|7th apartment from the left.
No, she lives on the 3rd floor,|8th apartment from the left.
No. Those first two windows,|that's the lobby.
That other window is the stairway.|You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that!|Thank you, Monica.
I almost lost another girl|because of counting!
- So, you ready?|- Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
- Could you get that?|- Sure.
No! No!
First, I would like to say|thank you for seeing me again.
That's all right.
But I feel obligated to tell you|that this meeting is being videotaped.
Well, first, I would like to start|by apologizing for kissing you...
...and for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Now, you're probably going to hire|one of the people who did not...
...yell at you and storm out.
And I think that's a big mistake.|And here's why.
I made a huge fool of myself,|and I came back. That shows courage.
When I thought you wanted sex|in exchange for this job, I said no.
That shows integrity.
And I was not afraid|to stand up for myself...
...and that shows courage.
Now, I know that I've|already said courage...
...but you've got to have courage.
And finally, when I thought|you were making sexual advances...
...I said no,|and I was not litigious.
So there you go!|You got courage...
...you got integrity,|you got courage again...
...and not litigious.
Look, Mr...
Zelner.
I knew that!
Oh, I knew that.
I really, really want this job.
And I think I would be|really good at it.
You know what?
I may regret this...
...but I'll give you a shot.
You are?
Really?
Thank you. Oh, God!
Would it be inappropriate|if I gave you a hug?
Well, how about a handshake?
Oh, God! I'm sorry!
I did not mean to touch that!|I mean, you!
There!
I'm gonna leave.|Thank you very much.
Hey, I'll see you Monday.
Are you tired?
You better believe he's tired|after the day we had!
If you know what I mean.|Do you know what I mean?
Honey? The tortilla chips|know what you mean.
Do you like that badge I got you?
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
Now, I gotta go.|Officer Bing's got a 10-100.
That's pee-pee.
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
We kind of took a detour|on our way over here.
We were strolling through the park|and no one was around, so...
- You didn't.|- We did!
We violated section 12,|paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
The park, huh?
Public place.
I hear you.|Can you excuse me for a second?
Hi, Chandler.
Monica, this is the men's room.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
But see, I've always found|the men's bathroom very sexual.
Haven't you?
No.
And if I did, I don't think|we'd be going out.
This is getting ridiculous.
Come on, we can't let them win!
We've proved that we are hot, okay?|So why are you obsessed about this?
Phoebe and Gary are in that...
..."can't keep their hands|off each other" phase!
So?
It makes me really sad that|we're not really there anymore.
Oh, is that what|this has all been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting|when we were...
...all over each other all the time?
Yeah, that was great.|That was really great.
But the truth is, I'm more|excited about where we are now.
- Really?|- Yeah.
I've never been in a relationship|this long before.
To get past the beginning and|still want to be around each other?
I think that's incredible.
And the fact that|this is happening with you...
...I think that's pretty exciting.
That's so sweet.
I know that I was acting|a little crazy...
...but I feel the same way.
You know what I just realized?
You just freaked out|about our relationship.
- I did not.|- Yes, you did!
Admit it. You freaked out!
I freaked out a little.
A little?|You freaked out bigtime, okay?
And I fixed it!|We have switched places.
I am the relationship king, and you|are the crazy, irrational screwup!
And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
Thank God!|I can't watch him anymore.
You guys ready?
By the way, thank you for|loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Man, they cannot get enough!
