I can't believe we've never|done this. It's so good!
It's so good for Monica.
Time's up! My turn.
- That was half an hour?|- It's your timer.
I don't like to brag about it,|but I give the best massages.
All right, then massage me up|right nice!
It's so good, isn't it?
I don't know what|I did to deserve it.
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Goodbye, muscles!
The One with Joey's Bag
She gives the worst massages ever!
It was like she was torturing me|for information.
I wanted to give it up.|I just didn't know what it was!
If it hurts that bad,|you should tell her.
For the first time,|I'm in a real relationship.
I won't screw that up|by telling the truth.
Dude, look out!
You almost crushed my hat.
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place|where you explain the hat.
There's this play, right?
I'm up for the part of this|cool, suave, international guy.
A clothes horse, so I figure...
...everyone at the audition will|wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And you'll make them disappear?
Like you could find something|this sophisticated.
Done!
If you want to look good,|come to the store. I'll help you.
- Thanks!|- Sure.
Please, take those off!
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
Only okay. Because I just|got back from the hospital.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.|But my grandma sort of died.
Pheebs, sorry.
It's okay.
She had a really incredible life.
It's not like I won't see her again.|She'll visit.
Maybe she's with us right now.
Right. She's on a new spiritual plain|and she'll come to the coffeehouse.
I just saw two people having sex|in a car right outside!
Pheebs' grandmother just died.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
Actually, it's kind of cool.|Because it's like...
...you know, one life ends|and another begins.
Not the way they're doing it.
What happened?|How did she die?
We were in the market...
...and she bent down to get some yogurt|and never came back up again.
I'm so sorry.
The last thing she said was:
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,|and we'll meet at the checkout counter."
You know what?
We will meet at the checkout counter.
Since you're returning|all this stuff...
...you'll have to wear underwear.
All right.|You'd better show me that too.
It's missing something.
Really? A purse?
It's not a purse.|It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's purse.
Trust me, all the men are carrying|them in the spring catalog.
See, look.|Men carrying the bag.
See, look.|Women carrying the bag.
But it is odd how a woman's purse|looks so good on me, a man.
Exactly. Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.|I had sex a couple days ago.
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.
I ain't going to say no to that!
- Who is it?|- It's Phoebe.
Oh, great!
Oh, you.
What's up?
Well, I sort of have some bad news.|Can I come in?
No, thanks.
Grandma died today.
Didn't she die like five years ago?
No, she just died today.
We're having|a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know I went to that already.
No, you didn't!
Then who's been dead?
Lots of people!
Look, are you coming or not?
I thought she was dead,|so I've made my peace.
Plus I'm going to a concert.
I'd invite you,|but I only have two tickets left.
- Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.|- Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!
You look just like your son,|Mrs. Tribbiani.
What? Are you referring|to my man's bag?
I thought it just looked good,|but it's practical too.
It's got compartments for your|wallet, keys, address book...
Your makeup.
What are you doing?|The audition's tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
You get mustard on that bag,|you can't return it.
Why would I return this?|I love this bag!
- All right, then you owe me $350.|- Fine.
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?
Relax, I'll pay you with the money|from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.
What's the part? Auntie Mame?
Don't listen to them.|I think it's sexy.
You-and-I sexy?
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.|Thank you for coming.
Here's your 3-D glasses.
Reverend Pong will say|when to put them on.
Hi, sweetie.
- How are you holding up?|- Fine.
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.
You know what?|My grandma had the exact same bag!
I brought you flowers.
Oh, thanks!
Pulling flowers out|makes the bag look masculine.
Excuse me, is this the memorial?
Welcome.
Here's your 3-D glasses.
All right.
So how did you know Frances?
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.
But I was pretty tight|with her and her daughter.
What's your name?
Frank Buffay.
You know what? Strike that.|My name, actually, is Joe.
Joe Hill.
You're Frank Buf...
No! Joe Hill.
You just said...
I got to go.|Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
That was my dad.
Check it out!
It's like it's coming right at me.
- Did you catch him?|- What did he say?
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."
I couldn't give him my real name.
Why not?
You saw the way he ran.
You think he'd talk|to the daughter he abandoned?
What did you say to him?
I said I was the executor of the will|and I needed to talk to him.
I'm going to meet him|at the coffeehouse.
Could everyone take their seats?
I just can't think about that now.
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.
Let's go say goodbye.
I'm off to my audition.|How do I look?
Great!|That bag will get you that part.
And a date with a man.
You know what? Make fun all you want.|This is a great bag.
And it's as handy as it is becoming.
Just because you don't understand|something, doesn't make it wrong.
You guys have to get used|to the fact that Joey...
...comes with a bag!
I've got to meet my dad.
Will you tell him who you are?
Not at first.|I don't want to freak him out.
But aren't you pissed at him?
This guy abandoned you.
If it were me, this guy would be|in some serious physical danger.
I'd walk in there,|I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!"
"You and me, outside.|Right now!"
I kind of scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
You'd think I'd be angry.
You'd think I'd want to rip|his tiny little head off!
Fortunately, I'm past it.
You do seem a little tense.|Here, let me help you.
Get off!
Stop it!|Why are you doing that to me?
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human...
...I'm begging you,|never do that to anyone!
I give good massages.
I gave them to Rachel|before she got allergic.
And Chandler, he loves them!|Watch.
He does not like it.|He's in pain!
- No, he's not.|- Yes, he is!
- What?|- I'm sorry but...
You've been lying to me?
I can't believe that.
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.
But the minute we start|to lie to each other...
And by "we"...
...I mean society.
Anytime you're ready.
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we get a table,|I buy you a drink.
Could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure.
Well, you must be new here.|Maybe we sit...
Can I ask you something?
Sure. What?
Well, first,|it's not a purse.
Anytime.
If you think|it's a woman's bag, it's not.
It's a man's bag.
Okay. And go!
Let me show you the catalog.
Look. See?
It's the latest thing.
Everyone's got one.|Men, women, children.
Do you sell these?
No, these babies sell themselves.
Thank you.|That was great.
But I didn't read anything.
I think we've seen enough.
All right, I'll see you.
We got it. We got it.
Is Rachel here?
Listen, I just wanted to apologize|about the whole massage thing.
I really like them.
Please stop!
We're supposed to be honest.
I wish you could tell me,|"I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
See? It's no big deal.
But now you're crying!
I'm not crying about that.|I'm crying about something at work.
My boyfriend said|he didn't like my massages.
You don't have|to be best at everything.
Oh, my God!|You don't know me at all!
You give the worst massages|in the world.
I'm crying here!
Look, hear me out.
You give the best bad massages.
If anybody was looking|for the best bad massage...
...and they thought,|"Who's the best?"
They'd have to go to you.
So you're saying that|if there was an award...
...for the best bad massage...|Who would get that?
It would be you!
You, Monica!|And you'd get all the votes.
So they could call the award,|"The Monica"?
Absolutely.
I suck!
Thank you for meeting me.
Thank you.
Come sit.
Sit.
Sit!
Alrighty.|Before we get started, I need you...
...to state for the record|that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
Yes, I am.
What did Frances leave me?
That's why you wanted me to come.
Yes, she did. She left you...
...this lipstick.
It's used.
Cool!
I have just a few questions to ask,|so I'll get out my official forms.
So question one:
You were married to Frances'|daughter, Lilly. Correct?
Yes, I was.
Question two:|Did that marriage end...
A: Happily?
B: Medium?
Or C: In the total abandonment...
...of her and her two children?
It really says that?
Yeah, see?
I guess then I would have to say C.
Total abandonment.
Reasons for abandonment:
A: Top secret government work.
B: Amnesia.
Or C: You're just a selfish,|irresponsible...
...bad, bad man.
I don't want the lipstick that much.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you give Lilly...
...that, please?
When you see Lilly,|give her that note.
I wanted to talk to her|at the memorial...
...but I pictured her getting mad|the way you did, and I chickened out.
I wrote her a note.|Give it to her, please?
But you came to see Lilly?
Yeah. Why?
Lilly's dead.
She what?
She's dead.
Are you sure?
If she isn't, cremating her|was a big mistake.
I can't believe this.|I just can't believe...
How?|Oh, my God.
How long ago?
17 years ago.
What about the girls?
Well, Ursula is a waitress|and she lives in Soho.
And Phoebe...
...is on this couch.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.|Big day for you!
Phoebe, I...
It's just, I don't know what to say.
I just can't believe that you're|my daughter. You're so pretty.
Yes, well, that's neither|here nor there.
Would it make you feel|better if I said...
...that I was very, very sorry I left?
It doesn't matter what you say.|It won't make a difference.
So you can just go.
Well, you know, in my defense,|I was a lousy father.
- That's your defense?|- Yes, it is.
I burned the formula,|and I put your diapers on backwards.
I made up a song to sing to you,|but that made you cry even more.
You make up songs?
Well, no, just that one.|But it was stupid.
Let's see, how did it go?
{y:i}Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
{y:i}Why won't you go to sleep?
{y:i}Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
{y:i}You're keeping me up
I'm not very good at this.
Well, I am.
Not yet. No.
How'd the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What? Why?|Joey, you were so ready for it.
I thought so too...
...but the casting people|had problems with me.
What kind of problem?
To tell you the truth...
...they had a problem with the bag!
You know what?|It was a stupid play anyway.
It's time to give up the bag.
I don't want to give up the bag.
I don't have to give it up,|do I, Rach?
You think I should give up the bag!
Joey, I'm sorry. As terrific|as I think you are with it...
...I just don't know if the world|is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe this!
Wait, I'm not saying|you shouldn't have a bag.
There are other bags|that are maybe a little less...
...controversial.
Yeah, they're called wallets.
