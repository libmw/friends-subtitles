What time is it?
Nine.
But it's dark out.
That's because you always|sleep till noon, silly.
This is what nine looks like.
I guess I'll get washed up then.
Watch that sunrise.
I'm getting tired of always|sneaking around.
Me too. What if we went away|for the weekend? No interruptions.
We could be naked|the entire time.
All weekend?|That's a whole lot of naked.
I'll say I have a conference|and you can have a chef thing.
I wanted to go to this|culinary fair in Jersey!
Okay.|You know you're not, though.
- Let's go.|- Okay. Wait.
What about Joey?
The One with the Kips
I'm going to a culinary fair|in Jersey this weekend.
How weird! Chandler just said|he's got a conference there.
That's funny. Seems like|Chandler's conference could've been...
...in Connecticut or Vermont.
I'm not in charge of where|the conference is held.
Do you want people to think it's fake?|It's a real conference.
- Is Rachel here?|- No, she's out shopping.
- Damn!|- What's going on?
I told Emily to come.
And I just need to, you know,|talk to Rachel about it.
Wait a minute.
When Emily comes,|you won't see Rachel anymore?
I'm focusing on the|"I get to see my wife" part...
...and not on the part|that makes me do this.
So you'll never be|in a room together?
How will that even work?
I have no idea.|I mean...
But I assure you,|I will figure it out.
It doesn't seem like it'll work.
Hi, guys.
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
So I'm thinking, basically,|we pick it up, and then we flip it.
That's better than my way.
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Oh, man.
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.
So, Rach?
You know how Emily's coming?
Oh, yeah. I know.
Can you hear anything?
Yeah, somebody just said,|"Can you hear anything?"
Hey, Joey's ass.
What are you doing?
Remember when they fought|and broke up...
...and we were stuck here|all night with no food?
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,|I figured it'd happen again.
So I hid this in here.
Candy bars, crossword puzzles...
"Mad Libs"! Mine!
Condoms?
You don't know how long|we'll be in here.
We may have to|re-populate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway, it all boils down to this.
- The last time I talked to Emily...|- Oh, my God! Our dog died!
- What?|- Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!
LaPooh's still alive?
It says he was hit by|an ice-cream truck and dragged for...
...nineteen blocks!
- Oh, my God.|- Sweetie, we heard you crying.
- Please don't cry.|- It's LaPooh!
I know, it's LaPooh right now|but it'll get better.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Chocolates on the pillows!|I love that!
You should live with Joey.|Rolos everywhere.
I'll be right back.
Oh, yes!
Get in here.|It's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.
Oh, dear God!|They gave us glasses!
The glasses have lipstick on them.
Who knows what else|they didn't change?
Sweetie...
...I just want this weekend|to be perfect.
We can change rooms, can't we?
Okay, but let's do it now.|Chopper Five just lost its feed!
You know how there was something|I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh, yeah.
I'm trying to work|things out with Emily.
Well, there's this...
...one thing.
Here goes.
I made a promise that...
- What?|- Your nose is bleeding.
Oh, God!
You're bleeding.
Not again.
This happened when|my grandfather died.
Sorry.
Gross.
Okay. So I'm sorry.|What did you want to tell me?
Sorry. Sorry.
I can't see you anymore.
I know, it's ridiculous.|I can't see you, either.
- I think you'll like this room more.|- Okay, great.
They say he's only got|half a tank left.
Half a tank? Still lots|of high-speed chasing to do!
- We're switching rooms again.|- What? Why?
This has a garden view.|We paid for an ocean view.
Our last ocean-view room|was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me. Can I talk to you|over here for just a second?
These clowns want to take us|for a ride. I won't let them.
We're not a couple of suckers.
I hear you, Mugsy.
All these rooms are fine.
Just pick one so I can watch the...
Have a perfect, magical|weekend together with you?
- This one I like.|- Nothing.
Nothing. It's over. Damn it!
This is regularly scheduled|programming!
Can we turn the TV off?
Do we really want to spend|the weekend like this?
Am I getting in the way|of the room-switching fun?
Don't blame me for tonight.
Who should I blame?|The nice bellman?
Or the idiot who thought|he could drive...
...from Albany to Canada|on half a tank of gas?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to be spending|a romantic weekend together.
What's the matter?
I just want to watch|a little television.
Jeez, relax, Mom.
What did you say?
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."
I've been wanting to tell you something|and I just have to get it out.
Okay. What's up?
You know how you said to do|whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily|whatever she wants.
And while that was good advice,|you should know that what she wants...
...is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy! You can't do that.|What are you going to tell her?
Oh, my God!
You've already agreed to this.
It's awful, I know.
But I have to do this|if I want my marriage to work.
And I do. I have to make|this marriage work. I have to.
But the good thing is, we can still|see each other until she gets here.
Lucky me! Oh, my God!|That is good news, Ross!
That's the best news I've heard|since LaPooh died!
You have no idea what a nightmare|this has been. This is so hard.
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?
- Let me make this easier for you.|- What are you doing?
- Storming out.|- It's your apartment.
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!
Damn Rolos!
You're back!|How was your conference?
It was terrible. I fought with|my colleagues for the entire time.
Are you kidding with this?
So your weekend was a bust?
No, I got to see Donald Trump|waiting for an elevator.
You're back too.
Could I talk to you for a second?
- How was your chef thing?|- It was awful.
Some people don't|appreciate good food.
Maybe the food tasted good at first...
...but then made everybody vomit|and have diarrhea.
How much was the room?|I'll pay my half.
Fine. $300.
$300?
Just think of it as $25 per room.
What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!
You know what?|Now that I think about it...
...I constantly find myself|without 20s, and you...
...always have lots.
You should've seen|the look on her face.
I don't want Rachel to hate me.|I don't know what to do.
- You want my advice?|- Yes. Please.
- You won't like it.|- That's okay.
You got married too fast.
- That's not advice.|- I told you.
I'm going to the bathroom.
If anyone asked me to give up|any of you, I couldn't do it.
Me neither.
Maybe I could do it.
I know you guys heard about|me and Ross.
But I've been obsessing about it|and would love not to talk about it.
I don't know if this falls|under that category...
...but Ross is right back there.
- That's not Ross.|- Not that guy.
He does look like him, though.
Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh, my God! It's happening.|It's already started. I'm Kip.
Yeah, you're not Kip.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel.
Who's Kip?
My old roommate.|We all hung out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
You told me the story.|He and Monica dated.
When they broke up, you all|promised you'd stay his friend.
And what happened?|He got phased out.
- You won't be phased out.|- Of course, I am.
It won't happen to Ross. He's your|brother, your college roommate.
It was just a matter of time.
I just assumed Phoebe|would be the one to go.
You live far away,|you're not related.
You lift right out.
Hey, Mr. Bing.
That hotel you stayed at called.
Someone left an eyelash curler|in your room.
Yes, that was mine.
I figured you met|a girl and she left it.
That would have made more sense.
I don't even feel like|I know you anymore.
All right, I'm just going|to ask you this one time.
Whatever you say,|I'll believe you.
Were you or were you not...
...on a gay cruise?
I'm sorry about the whole|"lifting out" thing.
You got to come with me.
- Where?|- Wherever I go.
You and me, we'll start a new group.|We're the best ones.
Okay, but try to get Joey too.
Pheebs, do you mind if I|speak to Rachel alone?
Sure.
Bye, Ross.
Forever.
Why are you here?|Isn't this against the rules?
I talked to Monica.
Look, I'm the one|who made the choice.
I'm the one who's making|things change.
So I should be the one to,|you know, step back.
No, no, it's okay. Really.
Plenty of people just see their|sisters at Thanksgiving...
...their college roommates|at reunions...
...and Joey at Burger King.
Is that better?
No, it's not better.
I still don't get to see you.
What would you do?|If you were me, what would you do?
First, I'd have said|the right name at my wedding.
I can't believe this.
I know.
I am so sorry.
I know that too.
Hey, Rach?
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said|you want to talk to me about a trip?
I just came over to drop off...
...nothing.
So that weekend kind of sucked.
Yeah, it did.
So I guess this is over?
You know, you and me.|I mean, it had to end sometime.
Why exactly?
Because of the weekend.|We had a fight.
Chandler, that's crazy.
If you always gave up|after a fight...
...you'd never be with anyone|longer than...
This isn't over?
You are so cute!
No, no. It was a fight.
You deal with it and you move on.|It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay, great!
Welcome to an adult relationship.
We're in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
I heard you saw Donald Trump|at your convention.
Saw him waiting for an elevator.
Can I use your eyelash curler?|I lost mine.
It's in the bathroom.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes.
Yes.
You?
And you?
But you cannot tell anyone.|No one knows.
But how? When?
- It happened in London.|- In London!
We didn't want to make|a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!|I have to tell someone!
You can't.
We just don't want to deal with|telling everyone.
Please just promise you won't tell.
All right.
Man, this is unbelievable!
I mean, it's great!
But...
I know. It's great!
I don't want to see that!
We're so stupid.
Do you know what's going on in there?|They're trying to take Joey!
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis|is called the overhand Phoebe."
"If you win, slap your opponent|on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe'!"
That's cute.|We really all enjoyed it.
- But it doesn't count.|- For what?
Just count in our heads|as good Mad Libs.
- I got to go.|- Fun's over.
Wait, if we follow the rules...
...it's still fun|and it means something.
I'm going to take off.
Guys, rules are good!
Rules help control the fun.
