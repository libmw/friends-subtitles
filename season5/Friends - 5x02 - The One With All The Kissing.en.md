You look cute in bubbles.
You're just all liquored up.
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Want some chicken?
No, thanks. No chicken.|Bye-bye.
You sure?|Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?
For the last time, no!|Get out, Joey!
All right.
Are you okay?|He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.
Chicken?
I could eat some chicken.
Could I get a three-piece,|some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?
Diet Coke.
The One With|All the Kissing
- Morning, Pheebs.|- I have to tell you this story.
I was coming over|and this cabdriver...
Was his name Angus?
What?
He was a cabdriver|we had in London.
All right. Anyway...
What was that pub he took us to?
The Wheat Sheaf!
And they had that beer...
Boddington's!
Pheebs was going to tell a story.
So, he had a really funny hat.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hey Ross!
Boddington's!
Oh, man!
I'd walk back to London for another|frosty one of those bad boys.
They have them at the|British pub by the Trade Center.
Later!
Shouldn't Rachel be back?
Her plane got delayed.
But she should be here by now.
So you talked to her?|Did she sound mad?
No. But she likes me.
You abandoned her|on a plane to Greece.
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?
Emily showed up at the airport.
I had to go after her.|I did what I had to do.
She's my wife.|Rachel is my wife.
Emily!
Emily is my wife.
Man, what is that?
You haven't heard from Emily?
Not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can outrun you.
Hey! She's fast, okay?
You think you can beat me?|Let's go! Outside!
Rach, I am so sorry.|I am so, so sorry.
Come on.|You just did what you had to do.
That's it? You're not mad?|It must've been terrible.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,|met the nice people.
It's not too shabby for Rachel.
So, what, that's it?
We're cool. Totally cool.
Thanks, Rach.|You're the best.
Oh, no. You're the best.
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
No one will tell me where Emily is...
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red|roses to her parents' house.
One for each day|I've known and loved her.
That should get her talking.
When you make out the card,|be sure to make it out to "Emily".
It's good that you had|such a good time in Greece.
What?
I didn't have a good time in Greece!
Ross abandoned me!
I couldn't get a plane out.|I had to stay in their suite!
People came up to me going,|"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"
I mean, it was so humiliating!
I felt like such an idiot!
It's all my fault.|You know why?
Because I make very bad decisions.
Oh, that's not true.
Yes, it is true.|I went after Ross in stupid London!
London is stupid! Stupid!
I should've never gone to London.
From now on, you make|all my decisions for me.
Oh, no.|I did that for someone once.
I'm not comfortable having|that power over someone's life.
I'll do it.
Fine. Monica, you are now|in charge of my love life.
Okay. I got to go to work.
And Rachel, great to have you back.
Always a pleasure.
Rachel? Sweetie, look.
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.
He's married.
Ross is married.|I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I'll just have to accept it.
I mean, it's my fault.
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!
Oh, my God!
That's okay. I know that|you're very upset right now.
I know that wasn't about me.
I bet it was about her a little.
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...
...you'd notice there are|great guys everywhere.
Look. Gunther.
He's nice. He's cute.
Yeah. I guess Gunther is...
What about that guy over there?
That's the guy you flirted with|at the counter.
Oh, I don't know.|I don't know.
You'll too talk to him.
I make your decisions,|and I say you'll too talk to him.
All right.
You're the boss.|I got to do what you tell me.
Say that to him, and you're golden.
Hey, Pheebs.|We got our pictures back from London.
Here's all of us|at the Tower of London...
Here we all are.
There's Ross and Joey and you and...
And me.
We've been talking about|London too much.
Sorry, it's just because|I couldn't be there.
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.|It bums me out.
- I'm sorry.|- Sorry.
- What happened?|- A little of this, a little of that.
I got myself a date tomorrow.
See? Didn't I tell you?|You're getting over Ross already.
Get out.
What took so long?
I got caught up at work.|But I'm quitting tomorrow.
So, thanks for having me over.
See you, man.
What the hell was that?
Probably some European|goodbye thing he picked up in London.
That's not European.
It felt French.
I really had a good time.
Yeah, me too.
I guess this is it.
Unless you want to come inside?
Wait a minute. You know what?|I can't decide this.
Okay. Just hold on a second.
Where's Monica?|I have to ask her something.
Doing her laundry.
What's that?
It came in the mail today.
It's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.
One for each day|I've known and loved Emily...
...cut up into mulch.
Honey, that's awful.
It's not so bad.
Monica's going to make potpourri.
I think I'm going to go|wander out in the rain for a while.
It's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
You're not going anywhere.|Sit right here.
I'll make you some tea|and we'll talk this out.
All right?
Hey, Dave.
I need to take a rain check.|My roommate is really sick.
Okay. Bye!
Honey, listen.
I know things seem so|bad...
...and that they won't get any...
Could I talk to you?
I dropped some socks.
What is the matter with you?|Do you want to fall into the trap?
You did not drop any socks!
I saw Dave, and he said|you blew him off!
You listen to me!
I'm calling the shots!|I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
What are you doing?
Well, ultimately I was trying,|you know, I wanted...
...to tell him that|I'm still in love with him.
What? You cannot tell him that!
Why? Why not?
People love to hear that!
I make the decisions and I say no!
You know what? No, you don't|make my decisions, because...
...you're fired.
You can't fire me.
I make your decisions,|and I say I'm not fired! Ha!
Well...
Come on, let me in!
Having some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in|if you give me some sugar.
Rachel! Let me in!
Thank you.
Rachel? Can I talk to you|outside for a sec?
We really need to talk.
Well, then talk.
Okay, I will.
Remember that thing we just discussed|that you wanted to do?
What thing?
Rachel wants to take|swing dance lessons.
Which I think is a really stupid idea.
It's dangerous.|She won't get what she wants.
And who knows who she might|end up hurting?
Monica's right.|Swing dancing can be tricky.
I have to use the phone.
I got to cancel those five, giant|teddy bears I sent to Emily.
My God! Think of the massacre.
I'm going to do it.
I know you think I'm crazy.
But before you tell him,|try to find one person...
...who thinks it's a good idea.|I bet you can't.
Please?
All right. Fine.
Joey! I'm in!
All right. Good deal.
You know how you were saying|you didn't get to go to London...
...and you were feeling left out?
Well, we all felt really bad|about that...
...so we decided to|take a little trip together!
Oh, that's so nice!
How great!|Where's the trip?
Well, we thought we would all|go to a picnic...
...in Central Park!
Central Park?
All of us. All day.
That sucks!
That's not a trip!|I just came from there.
What'll we high-five about|at the stupid park?
It's right by my house.|All right!
I'm going home to bask in the|triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.
I wanted to talk to you about...
...this whole new European thing|you've got going on.
And I need to say|it makes me very uncomfortable...
...and I just, you know, just stop it!
Just bringing some culture|to the group.
That's fine.|Just don't bring it in my mouth.
It makes me want to puke.
Hey, everybody!|Pheebs is here!
- Phoebe! Woo!|- Okay. Woo! Hi!
Pheebs, we decided that|the picnic idea was a little...
It didn't have any...|Well, it blew.
We thought that this afternoon we'd|all go away for the whole weekend...
...to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City! Oh, that's|a great plan! Whose plan was that?
Mine!
- Wait. It was my plan.|- No...
...I said we needed a new plan.
And I came up with Atlantic City.
Which is the new plan.
Why don't we all|meet upstairs in an hour.
I'm going to go pack.|I'm going to go pack my ass off.
Let's go.
You know what?|I'll meet you in a minute.
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,|so you can't tell him.
You know what?|That doesn't matter.
Do you know how painful it is|to tell someone you love them...
...and not have them say it back?
I don't care.
I can't watch.
What you reading?
Paper.
Yeah? What's it about?
The events from around the globe.
There's something|I have to talk to you about.
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.
But I think they're wrong.|People can be wrong.
Once at work...
...I thought carbon dating|is fossilized...
I'm really trying to tell|you something here.
Go ahead.
I think I'm just going to say it.
I'm just going to say it.
I'm still in love with you.
I'm not sure what to do|with that right now.
What? Was that a joke?|Because it's mean.
I'm so dead serious!
I'm totally serious!
Why are you laughing?
Because I just heard it!
I heard it! And it's ridiculous!
I mean...
You're married!
You're married,|and it's just ridiculous!
When I said it, I sort of|floated up out of my body.
And then I heard myself say it,|and then the floating Rachel...
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
- Well, I am married.|- I know.
Though I haven't spoken to her|since the wedding.
I'm sorry. That's not funny.
Actually, it kind of is.
My wife won't return my calls.
I don't know where my wife is.
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"|"Don't know!"
Oh, God!
You know what?|Could you forget I told you this?
Well, I kind of have to.
Because the thing is...
The thing is, you know,|that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.
Oh, God.
Things won't be weird between us,|right? Was that stupid?
Me telling you that?
I'm glad you did.
If nothing else...
...it's always great when someone|tells you they love you.
That's what I said!
- Thank you for being so nice.|- No. Thank you for...
Thank you.
- Okay, let's go!|- Yeah, Atlantic City!
Come on!
Atlantic City, baby!
Let's roll some bones.|Hey, Joey!
High-five for rolling bones.
Pheebs, you're leaking.
Oh, my God! Your water broke!
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.
Pheebs, we have to take you|to the hospital now.
Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Honey! High-five!|The babies are coming!
Remember when my water broke?
Phoebe's going to have her babies!
I know.|It's beautiful and amazing.
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel|every time I left the room.
It's too bad they didn't|see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
- It's all right.|- Okay.
