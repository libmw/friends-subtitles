"We've got three minutes
till the reactor blows.

"We'll never make it! "

"You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself! "

"No, I won't leave you."

"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine! "

-"No, you're not. Not to me."
-Oh, my God.

-What?
-I am extremely talented.

-Yeah. You're great.
-Yeah.

-Okay, let's take it from--
-No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.

I thought I was pretty good, too.

Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

I don't want to be over-rehearsed.

Fine. I'll do it without you!

I don't need you or anybody else!

I'm gonna make it on my own!

You'll see! You'll all see!

The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

English subtitles by Softitler

So, what's this thing
you're auditioning for?

It's a new TV show. Yeah.

I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with the help of my robot partner.

He's a computerized humanoid...

...electronically enhanced, secret enforcer.

Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E."

-So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-That's the title!

They really lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."

That is lucky.

So Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

...the star of your own TV show.

I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!

Don't get your hopes up,
because it's probably not gonna happen.

Now, why would you say that, Joseph?

Well, I mean, come on you guys.
My own TV show?

-I don't know if I'm good enough.
-I am.

What are you talkin' about?
You're a terrific actor.

-You really think so?
-How can you even ask that question?

-She's pretty.
-Yeah. And she's really nice, too.

She taught me all about, you know,
how to work with cameras...

...and "smell the fart" acting.

-I'm sorry. What, Joey?
-What? Excuse me?

It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

...that sometimes you need a minute
to remember your next one.

So while you're thinkin' of it, you take
this big pause where you look all intense.

You know, like this.

Okay.

Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

Mrs. Wallace?

I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

You sister is suffering from a....

Well, Eva, we've done
some excellent work here.

And I would have to say
your problem is quite clear.

"All you want is a tinkle

"What you envy's a schwang

"A thing through which you can tinkle

"Or play with or simply let hang"

I play AI Pacino's butt.

All right?

He goes into the shower and then,
I'm his butt.

-Oh, my God.
-Come on, you guys.

This is a real movie and AI Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

No, it's terrific. You deserve this
after all your years of struggling...

...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

-No, you're right, it is.
-Yeah.

So, you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.

"Good luck, good luck
We all wish you good luck"

Yeah, whatever.

It's your turn.

Oh, are we playing this?

Hi. How did the audition go?

Terrible. I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

Wait. Are you doin' that thing
where you pretend it didn't go well...

...but it really did go well?

-Yeah, did I fool ya?
-Totally!

-So, it did go well?
-It went amazingly well!

-Great!
-That's great.

-It's down to me and two other guys.
-Oh, my God!

I know both of them,
and they're really good.

One's from those allergy commercials
who's always being chased...

-...by those big flowers.
-Oh, I love that guy!

What are you doing?

What am I doing?

I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback isn't 'til tomorrow at 5:00.

I feel like my head's gonna explode.

Well, it is overdue.

Don't worry, okay? You're gonna be fine.

Yeah, but it's so much pressure.

No offense, but what you guys all do
is very different.

I don't know if you'd understand.

Yeah, none of the rest of us
have to deal with pressure at our jobs.

Yes, I know what time it is, but I'm looking
at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.

Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

-Is it dirty?
-No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.

Don't. I like it dirty.

That's your call.

So, what are you going to do next?

Well, I thought
that I would cut up the tomatoes.

Are they firm?

They're all right.

You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?

No, really. They're okay.

You gonna slice 'em up real nice?

Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.

I'm out of here.

Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...

...and she didn't even buy it.

I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

Well, what happened?

Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

Oh, my God.

And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.

-Was it?
-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

You ate my sandwich.

It was a simple mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

Really?

Now calm down.

Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

-What?
-Well, it was quite large.

I had to throw most of it away.

You threw my sandwich away?

My sandwich?

My sandwich!

It's just, I want this part so much,
you know?

If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat
macaroni and cheese again.

No, I didn't say that. That doesn't count.

Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

I just moved across the hall.

And we would have you over all the time...

...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

You're right, I could never lie to you.

She hates you.

Should I get that?

Hello? No, Joey's not here right now.

Can I take a message?

Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved
from 5:00 to 2:30?

Okay, great. Bye.

-Aren't you dressed yet?
-Am I naked again?

We're supposed to meet my parents
in 15 minutes.

Okay. I was just talkin' to the guys.
Just look at 'em.

I mean, is it okay if they come visit?

What about my allergies?

Right. Your allergies.

All her. She hates you.

Yes! All right.

How cool would it be if you could watch
like a real life-size version of this?

-I mean, how crazy would that be?
-As crazy as soccer?

Hello?

What are you talkin' about?
The audition's not 'til 5:00.

Well, nobody told me.

Who'd you talk to?

Never mind.

You mean you didn't get it from this?

The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.

Maybe we can fix it, you know?

Maybe we can send him
some big, big flowers and scare him!

How could you do this to me?

This part could've turned
my whole career around.

I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

You don't even live here anymore.
Why'd you answer my phone?

-I have a machine!
-Which I bought for ya.

Taught ya how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

If there was anything I could do,
I would do it, okay?

But everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

He could have gotten me a VCR.

He could have gotten me golf clubs.

But no, he has to get me
the "Woman Repeller."

The eyesore from
the "Liberace House of Crap! "

-It's not that bad.
-Easy for you to say.

You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T" collection.

Chandler. Chandler.

I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do! I do!

I pity the fool that....

When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking and...

...one thing led to another and....

And what? Did you sleep with her?

-No! No, I just kissed her.
-What? That's even worse!

-How is that worse?
-I don't know! But it's the same!

You're right, I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

"Over the line?"

You're so far past the line
that you can't even see the line!

Yeah, the line is a dot to you!

I'm not saying that you should
magically forgive me.

But you're not perfect.
You've made some errors in judgment, too.

Name one!

What happened?

Man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

What the hell happened?
How were you locked in?

And where the hell's all of our stuff?

This guy came by to look at the unit...

...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

So you got in voluntarily?

I was tryin' to make a sale!

Man, if I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

Bend over?

There's Lori.

Okay, now remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.

Well, well. Look what you brought.

And what did you bring?

She's checking her coat.

Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice.

Janice?

Oh, my God!

Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

What?

No way. I've been goin'
to the guy for 12 years.

You said he was gonna do my inseam...

...then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite....

What?

Cupping.

That's how they do pants!

Ross, will you tell him?

-Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
-Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

I said name one!

-I can't believe I did this. What an idiot!
-Stop beating yourself up.

People make mistakes.
These things happen.

I hope there aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me, are there?

Apparently, you're not very good at it.

-Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
-Of course he will.

Chandler, the most important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

-You know what, I kind of have.
-Already?

That was pretty bad what you did.

You know what? He will forgive you.

I like to bring a pad with me when I go
answer the phone, just in case. Okay?

You didn't see how mad he was,
you know?

I'm sure he will forgive you.

Look, we've all been there, you know?
You fight, you make up.

That's the way it works.

It took two people to break up
this relationship!

Yeah! You and that girl from
the copy place...

...which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!

I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

I didn't finish the whole letter.

-What?
-I fell asleep.

You fell asleep?

It was 5:30 in the morning.

And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

Front and back!

And by the way?
Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."

Y-O-U-R means "your."

I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

We are so over!

Fine by me!

And just so you know,
it's not that common...

...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

I knew it!

You had no right to go out with him.

That is the most ridiculous--

-You sold me out!
-I did not sell you out!

-Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me--
-Would you let me talk?

Did you just flick me?

Okay, well you wouldn't let me finish
and I was just--

Stop it!

-Stop.
-Stop.

-All right. No, let's not do this.
-No!

-Happy thoughts.
-No!

-Happy thoughts.
-No!

Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

-Fine.
-Fine.

There we go.

You know what? lf we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

You hide my clothes?
I'm wearin' everything you own.

Oh, my God!

Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearin' any more clothes?

Maybe if I wasn't going "commando".

I tell ya, it's hot with all this stuff on.
I'd better not do any lunges.

"I think of all the friends I've known

"But when I dial the telephone

"Nobody's home

"All by myself

"Don't want to be
all by myself

"Anymore

"All by myself"

Joey?

Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!

Hello? Damn it!

Hello?

No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

Well, that's great.
I will give Joey the message. Thank you.

Yes!

Okay.

Mac...

...audition...

...at 2:00.

Allergy...

...actor...

...attacked.

By dog...

...not...

...flowers.

Please tell me you got the message.

-What message?
-The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.

-They needed to see you at 2:00.
-What? It's 6:00!

Look! I wrote it! I wrote it on the board!

I wrote it down,
then went lookin' all over for ya!

I went to Ross's, the coffee house....

I went to any place
that they make sandwiches!

-I can't believe this, Chandler!
-I'm sorry.

I don't know what to say!

You might say, "Congratulations! "

I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

Was that supposed to be funny?
I was worried over here.

-I'm sorry.
-At times that fake-out thing is just mean.

Okay, man. I'm sorry.
I did not mean to make you feel bad.

Well, that's good.

Because ya didn't!
And I'm incredibly happy for ya!

That's mean!

-You had me goin' there!
-We could do this all day.

Yeah, you're right.

Look, let's talk about
what a huge star I'm gonna be.

You are gonna be a huge star!
I'm gonna hug ya!

-You hug me!
-All right.

"You've really got a hold on me

"You've really got a hold on me

"Baby!

"I love you

"And all I want you to do is just
Hold me

"Please

"Squeeze me, hold me"

-Do we do this too much?
-I think so.

-Yeah. Get off me.
-Yeah.

"Come on, C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

"Try routing your backup power source
through your primary CPU."

"I can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you! "

"Well, then I'll just have to carry you! "

"That'll be a neat trick...

"...when you're dead! "

Ross, you don't have to yell.

There was just an explosion, okay?
My hearing would be impaired.

I thought you were excellent.

In fact, for a minute there, I was like,
"Where did Ross go?"

Thank you. And I have to say
that first scene where you meet Mac....

-Yeah?
-Oh, my God. I mean....

And you know what?

I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

-Holding us back.
-Totally.
